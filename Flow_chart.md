# Project Flow Chart

You may write your flow chart here or upload it as a separate file. 
* If you upload it, be sure to upload a new version at the end, keeping the original version.
* If you use this one, the original will still be available so you just need to save (commit) each time you make changes.

Define all of the different functions and variables
m is money, x is cure, y is spread (NOT THE SAME IN MY ACTUAL CODE)

Function A: input all the information about what is going to happen

Function B: ask the user for the difficulty, easy, medium, or hard
If easy: set x to 2, y to 0:                
If medium: set x to 1, y to 2:
If hard set x to 0, y to 4: 

when cure >= 5 and spread is < 7: they win
when y >= 7: they lose


Function C: ask user for input on what to do first: invest money in reasearch(a) invest money in buying a fancy car(b):
if a: r = r + 5, y = y + 1, m = m - 5 
if b: y = y + 2 

Function D: ask the user for input on what to do next: invest more money in reasearch(a) collect a sample of the disease(b):
if a: r = r + 3, y = y + 1, m = m - 5
if b: r = r + 5, y = y + 1, m = m - 2 

Function E: ask the user for what to do next: cancel all flights(a) fly to another planet to escape the disease(b)
if a: y = y + 1, x = x + 2, m = m + 5
if b: say that they lose

Function F: ask user for what to do next: invest more money reasearch(a) cancel all country to country transportation(b) 
if a: if r = 10: r = r + 5 and m = m - 5 and x = x + 1 if r < 10: r = r + 2 and m = m - 5

Function G: ask user for what to do next: Invest in the cure(1) or quarentine everyone(2):
if 1: m = m - 5, x = x + 3
if 2:
