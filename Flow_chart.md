# Project Flow Chart

You may write your flow chart here or upload it as a separate file.

Function A: input all the information about what is going to happen

Function B: ask the user for the difficulty, easy, medium, or hard
If easy: set x to 2 and y to 0:                
If medium: set x to 1 and y to 2:
If hard set x to 0 and y to 4: 
when x >= 5 and y is <= 10: they win
when y >= 10: they lose
when y > 5: say that the disease is spreading quickly and tell them to be very careful
m = 10

Function C: ask user for input on what to do first: invest money in reasearch(a) invest money in buying a fancy car(b):
if a: r = r + 5 and y = y + 1 and m = m - 5 
if b: y = y + 2 

Function D: ask the user for input on what to do next: invest more money in reasearch(a) collect a sample of the disease(b):
if a: r = r + 3 and y = y + 1 and m = m - 5
if m = 0: say that they are out of money and x = x + 1 
if b: r = r + 5 and y = y + 1 and m = m - 2 

Function E: ask the user for what to do next: cancel all flights(a) fly to another planet to escape the disease(b)
if a: y = y + 1 and x = x + 2 and m = m + 5
if b: say that they lose

Function F: ask user for what to do next: invest more money reasearch(a) cancel all country to country transportation(b) 
if a: if r = 10: r = r + 5 and m = m - 5 and x = x + 1 if r < 10: r = r + 2 and m = m - 5
