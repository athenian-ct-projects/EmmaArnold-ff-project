# Focus Day Project Decomposition: Epidemic Day

* I am making a code where the people are going to have to stop a deadly disease from spreading and killing the enitre world. I am going to prompt the user/s with different imputs and they are going to have to answer these with their previous knowledge about diseases. 

* Write your plan here. Use headings an bullet points to organize your thoughts. See the Markdown guide for formatting hints.

 # First I will define all of the different functions (5/12) 
 # Next, I will add all the inputs that will prompt the user/s for an answer (5/18)
 # I will add if and while loops with different scenarios based on what the inputs are by the user (5/18)
 # Set up the print statements to tell the user whether they killed the world or not (5/18)
 # Then, I will test the code to see what is working, and what i did wrong (5/19)
 # I will troubleshoot and try to fix my code, and I will get help from Meghan (5/19)
 # Fix my code, and maybe add more detail if it isnt that long (5/19-20)
