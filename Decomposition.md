# Focus Day Project Decomposition: Epidemic Day

* I am making a code where the people are going to have to stop a deadly disease from spreading and killing the enitre world. I am going to prompt the user/s with different imputs and they are going to have to answer these with their previous knowledge about diseases. 

* Write your plan here. Use headings an bullet points to organize your thoughts. See the Markdown guide for formatting hints.

# First, I will define all the functions (5/12)
# Set up a lot of the notes so that I can understand my code(5/12-5/14)
# Then, I will set up all the inputs that promt the user for an answer (5/15-5/22)
# I will set up all math eqautions for the variables based on what the input was by the user(5/15-5/22)
# I will add if statements that determine whether the user has won or lost yet (5/24)
# Troubleshoot a lot with Meghan(5/27)
# Add the for loop that counts down the seconds before the game starts (5/27)
# Play the code and make it so that the variable changes make sense(5/28)
